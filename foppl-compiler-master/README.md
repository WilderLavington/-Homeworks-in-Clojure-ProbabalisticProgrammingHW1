# foppl-compiler

This is a WIP implementation of the FOPPL compiler of the book [An Introduction to Probabilistic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10756).

The compiler transforms a first order programming language in Clojure syntax into an immediate graph representation that lends itself to different inference methods.
